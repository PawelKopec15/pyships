## PyShips
#### A battleships clone written in PyGame

### Controls:
Right mouse button - rotate ship <br> Left mouse button - everyting else

### Additional info:
Since the opponent has the dumbest AI possible, he has two shots per turn instead of one to make it more difficult.

Also I wanted the game to be pretty and forgot I'm not writing in C++ but instead in a language I hardly know or understand, so the game runs at about 10 fps if it decides to be nice.<br>That being said, all graphics are made by me.
